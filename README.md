Assignment about SBERT, Gradient Descent and Attention Mechanism


1. SBERT-ADL-assignment2

In this file we implement a search function that enables users to find relevant GIFs from a dataset.
It utilizes a transformer model to create embeddings for GIF descriptions and matches them with user queries.


2. Assignment2-part2

Description:
This file elaborates on gradient descent and attention mechanism concepts.
Features:
Gradient Descent: Demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent for updating weights in a machine learning model using two examples.
Attention Mechanism: Explores the concept of attention mechanism using the example of sentence with homonyms (in our task we used the word book).
